## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a frontend software engineer passionate about the web and its technologies, currently building the future of corporate events at [Kampaay](https://www.kampaay.com).

I use GitLab for work so you won't see much going on here for now, but I always use GitHub for personal and side projects.
