## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer passionate about the web and its technologies.

My primary technical stack is TypeScript, React and Tailwind CSS, but I also work on various products using Vue and Nuxt. I'm also passionate about full stack development, especially when it comes to setting up infrastructure and networks using AWS, Cloudflare, Docker, and self-hosted solutions like Linux-based VMs with Caddy or nginx.
